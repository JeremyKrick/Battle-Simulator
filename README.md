# Battle-Simulator
A Python3 model and simulation of Lanchester’s Law for Aimed Fire which predicts, based upon Euler’s method, which opposing force would win a battle of attrition. Variables available are x and y troop levels and their respective lethality coefficients. 

- Initial x-troop: 1000
- Initial y-troop: 800
- Alpha lethality coefficient: 0.8
- Beta lethality coefficient:  0.9
- **x-troop wins at time 1.48**
